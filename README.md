While in my coding bootcamp we utilized JHipster to handle the quick set up for our final group assignment. 
I want to take the time now to dive into Spring to be comfortable making applications from the ground up, knowing how everything works.
This understanding will flow directly into my own passion project Rollin' Thunder, for which I'm going to start over without JHipster and soley use Spring.
